                        Savings Bank Deposits

                    </h2>
                        <p>How many people will you find around who doesn't have one? A Savings Bank account is one of the very basic deposit ideas before any person. It stresses and highlights the importance of having to save money for future benefits. It's not a big deal at all as any one with even basic income levels can own one. These accounts make customers set aside a portion of their liquid assets while earning a monetary return.The Savings Bank scheme at The Thondiyil Service Co-operative Bank too is one such. Any person, no matter what his/her income level is, can start one. All you need in hand is Rs. 100 and you can start saving. As opposed to many other banks, we don't trouble you with too many paperwork for the same. You get to start an account with everything that would enable stress-free banking. Interest is calculated based on the account balance on each day.
                            
                            </p>
                            <h2><i class="flaticon-verified"></i>Fixed Deposits</h2>
                            <p>A Fixed Deposit offers you something more than a normal savings bank account does. It is a fixed amount of money that you deposit for a fixed period of time, until maturity that offers a higher rate of interest. Fixed Deposits are generally very safe investments and are used to denote a larger class of investments with varying levels of liquidity.Usually it cannot be withdrawn before the date of maturity and this ensures that the money is fully safe and would achieve its full range of potential by the date of maturity. You have the facility to close the account at any time by paying the 1% premature closure charge additionally.



                                The Thondiyil Service Co-operative Bank offers long-term and short-term fixed deposits for its customers. The customers can select what and how much to invest and get assured and solid returns on investment. The customers have the option to choose from a number of duration periods and decide on what is convenient and most suited for their requirements.</p>
                        <h2><i class="flaticon-verified"></i>Current Account</h2>
                        <p>Here's something truly special for business people. The Thondiyil Service Co-operative Bank current accounts are specially designed for business people and enterprises such as proprietors, partnership firms, public and private companies, trusts, association of persons and so on, both large scale and small scale.

                            The advantage with current account is that money can be deposited and withdrawn at any time without giving any kind of notice. Moreover, it is also suitable for making payments to creditors by making use of cheques. In a current account, cheques received from customers can be deposited for collection too.</p>
                            <h2><i class="flaticon-verified"></i>Daily Deposit Scheme</h2>
                            <p>On an endeavour to promote savings habit among common people, The Thondiyil Service Co-operative Bank has given life to a special scheme deposits. This is a daily deposit scheme wherein the customers can keep adding to their bank balance small or big amounts of their choice. This scheme is particularly beneficial for people who work on a daily wage basis and also among small income groups. They can keep their bank accounts alive and active by contributing even amounts below Rs. 100.



                                The biggest advantage with the deposit scheme is that the customers needn't even come to any of our bank branches to deposit the money. They can hand it over to our pigmy collection agents who would go to them and collect the amount, so that they can devote themselves fully to work. These agents will have palmtech machines with them and will regulate the transaction deals of these customers through it.
                                
                                </p>
                                <h2><i class="flaticon-verified"></i>Recurring Deposits</h2>
                                <p>Recurring deposits are term deposits more or less like fixed deposits in their very nature. They are made for specified periods of time like a year or more. The interest rates for them are the same that are applicable to fixed deposits. You just need to add fixed amounts (multiples of Rs. 50) of money to it on a monthly basis for periods of 12, 24, 36 or 60 months. The difference is that you won't have to wait till a maturity period in case you wish to withdraw the deposit. You get the interest until the date of withdrawal as well.



                                    Recurring deposits are helpful and advantageous in many ways. The important factor is that you get good interest rates for the amount deposited. Also, whenever you are in need of money, you can always withdraw the deposit with assured interest calculated until the date of withdrawal. It empowers the customers with an opportunity to build up their savings through regular monthly deposits of fixed sum over a fixed period of time.
